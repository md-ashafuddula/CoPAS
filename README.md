## Installation Guide:
The code is based on Python 3.8.0

1. Download the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/zqiuak/CoPAS
```

2. Go to the `main` folder and install requested libarary.
```bash
cd main
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Typically, it will take few minutes to complete the installation.


## Run
1. Fill the data path in ```PathDict.py```, the sample is given in the file.
2. Change parameters in ```Args.py``` to fit your data.
#### Run the following command for training:
```bash
python run.py
```

#### Optional:
```
python run.py --epochs 200 --batch_size 4 --lr 1e-3 --gpu 1 --augment True
```

#### Run the following command for testing:
```bash
python run.py --test --weight_path PATH_TO_WEIGHT
```

#### Sample
```
python run.py --test --weight_path /path/to/trained_model.pth
```

#### Other useful command line arguments:
```--epochs```: Maximum number of epoches in training.<br>
```--batch_size```: Batch size.<br>
```--lr```: Initial learning rate.<br>
```--gpu```: GPU card number.<br>
```--augment```: ```bool```, use augmentation or not.<br>
